# customizable-pendulam-simulation
I build this in less than a day, so dont judge me 😁😁 A pendulam which u can customize the factors affecting the motion of it like gravity, length, etc. No exterior library is used to the pendulam, The math is raw.

Only Tkinter, pygame and math library is used in the project.
